# 🎓 CS Projects

This repository is a collection of my university computer science coursework, technical practice, and independent learning projects.  
Each subfolder focuses on a specific topic or data structure, primarily implemented in **C++**, with clean organization and documentation.

## 📁 Current Topics

### 📚 Data Structures (C++)
Core data structure implementations with methods, sample output, and comments:
  
| Structure          | Folder                                                      | Notes                                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Singly Linked List | [`linked_list`](data_structures/linked_list/)               | Insert, display, destructor included |
| Binary Search Tree | [`binary_search_tree`](data_structures/binary_search_tree/) | Insert, search, inorder traversal    |
| Stack (Array)      | [`stack`](data_structures/stack/)                           | Push, pop, peek, display             |
| Queue (Array)      | [`queue`](data_structures/queue/)                           | Enqueue, dequeue, peek, display      |
| Hash Map           | [`hash_map`](data_structures/hash_map/)                     | Basic hash table with chaining       |

➡️ All projects contain their own `README.md` and testable `main()` functions

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- **C++** for all core implementations  
- Python or C may be added in future folders

## 🧠 What's Next?

Planned additions:
- ✅ Doubly Linked List  
- ✅ Circular Queue  
- ✅ BST Deletion + Traversals  
- 🔐 Cybersecurity tools (port scanner, hashing demo)  
- ⚙️ Systems programming projects (file I/O, memory sim)
